# Probability-Calculator-N-sided-Dice
This application is a simulation for rolling (m) number of (n) sided die (k) times. There are two simulation options available, one for rolling a single die, and another for rolling multiple dice. 

After simulation of either a single or multiple roll event the probability distribution chart will populate and results for the graph will be printed below.
