# Probability-Calculator-N-sided-Dice
This application is a simulation for rolling (m) number of (n) sided die (k) times. There are two simulation options available, one for rolling a single die, and another for rolling multiple dice. 

### UI Components
- Header & Instructions
- Single dice roll simulator
- Multiple dice roll simulator
- Probability Distribution Graph
- Probability results printed

For the front-end of this application I implented a graph visualization of the probability distribution for each simulation using Rechart. Rechart is a Redefined chart library built with React and D3. I also designed a user friendly input calculator for simulating the single and multiple dice rolls. Input fields are clearly labeled and easily understood due to the instructions on site page. Upon cliking the bright blue simulate in either 'single roll' or 'multiple rolls' the button will asynchronously run a simulation of the dice roll event, displaying the outcome of each dice roll as well illustrated boxes with numbers representing the dice and each number rolled for that simulation.
